# Dealing with an unresponsive SME

## **THE FIRST RULE OF SMOTH COOPERATION**
## Difficult SME is a person like you are.



###  **Make an appointment**
Confirm it before the meeting. Do not take it for granted. Try to work around their schedule. SME's are quite busy, so be flexible.


### **Be prepared**
Prepare for the meeting. You don't need to know everything (You are not a SME yet). But have your questions ready. You need to know what do you want to ask about. 
 
### **Make a good start**
It's good to know what type of person is your SME. Try to get some information before you will meet the first time. Get some perspective from others. Try to find some points you may have in common. If SME you meet is a huge fan of crazy socks or british crime stories, your life will be much easier. 


When you finally meet, be polite, but not on your hands and knees. Go for some small talk, but mind the time. Be friendly. Show that you appreciate their work. Keep things clear.


### **Ask the questions**

Listen carefully, make some notes or record the meeting to avoid misunderstandings, but ask for permission first. Listen even if The Subject Matter Expert seems a bit pompous. Be open minded. Try to learn as much as you can from the person who knows more than you about the subject. Have the questions written down to make sure, all of them were answered.

### **Dot the final** 
 
Close the meeting saying for example, that you have a lot of material to work on, but ask if they want to add something you didn't mention.Thank for their time and conversation. 

Send a thank you mail, and the feedback. The worst thing you can get is to be ignored. But in the other hand you have a chance to get SME more involved in your project. 


PS. Somebody mentioned using a cheesecake. The alternative (depends on SME) can be healthy cookies made with no sugar, no flour and no taste at all. Whatever works.
